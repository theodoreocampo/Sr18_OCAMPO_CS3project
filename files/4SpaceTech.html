Technology nowadays has never been better. This has resulted in us being able to build very advanced rockets. There also have been some companies who have big, big plans for the future. 
 </p>
  <p id="p1">ㅤ</p>
  <p id="p1">ㅤ</p>
  <p id="p1">Here is an excerpt from an article:  </p>
  <p id="p1">“Google is looking upward for its next big project. The company announced that it has signed a 60-year lease with NASA for a 1,000-acre site that it plans to use for research and development in the areas of space exploration, robotics and other emerging technologies. It also plans to renovate three large hangars.”  </p>
  
  <p id="p1">One Major Tech giant that we all know about is Google. As seen from the article, it recently signed a lease with NASA in order to research and develop more in the area of space exploration, and for some other (unrelated) fields, too.  </p>
 
  <p id="p1">ㅤ</p>
  <p id="p1">Google is not alone in their intentions to expand in terms of space exploration and technology, however. 
 </p>
 
  <p id="p1">ㅤ</p>
  <p id="p1">SpaceX, a company owned by billionaire Elon Musk, also has plans to put satellites in space, but this time it is to provide high-speed internet access to people who would not normally have access to the internet in their region. Their website actually already has a page to ‘pre-order’ it, but who knows when they will come. 
    
  <p id="p1">ㅤ</p>
 </p>
  <p id="p1">	The very same company has also been developing a specific spacecraft, called Starship. It has been planned to be fully reusable, to carry either passengers or cargo. It will be able to land on any rocky planet in the Solar System, though it would require refueling in Earth orbit first. For launch on earth, due to the high gravitational pull and atmospheric drag, it would require a first-stage booster known as Super Heavy. 
    
 </p>

  <p id="p1">ㅤ</p>
  <p id="p1">	A lot of people will know NASA’s Artemis mission. On NASA’s website, it is described as “the first step in the next era of human exploration.” As such, the main goal of Artemis is to create/establish a ‘sustainable presence’ on the moon for Mars missions. 
 </p>
  <p id="p1">	There also are other spacecraft that are in the workings, such as the Boeing Starliner, and Orion, with the latter being planned to be used in NASA’s Artemis mission. 
 </p>
  <p id="p1">	Space technology is just going to get better and better. There have been some plans for making spaceflight commercially available, but we may have to wait for that a bit more. With the increasing amounts of information we can gather though, it’s only a matter of time before that is achieved.
