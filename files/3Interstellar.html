There are a few, among the multiple probes that were launched by NASA, who have become Interstellar Probes.</p> 
  <p id="p1">Interstellar Space is defined as the place after the heliopause. The heliopause is, from its name, the place where the Solar Wind (charged particles produced by the Sun) fails to stop the Winds of other stars.</p>
  <p id="p1">Interstellar Probes are probes who have already passed the heliopause, or are expected to pass it with their current trajectory. </p>

  <h4 id="p1">All about Voyager 2</h4>
  <p id="p1">Voyager 2 will be the first NASA Voyager mission. It was launched on Aug. 20, 1977, at 14:29:44 UT. It had a twin probe, the Voyager 1. </p>
  <p id="p1">It successfully completed a Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune Flyby. </p>

  <p id="p1">ㅤ</p>
  <p id="p1">ㅤ</p>
  
  
  <h4 id="p1">Here are some of its accomplishments: </h4>
  <p id="p1">-pictures and data on the planets that it performed a flyby
  <p id="p1">-the discovery of 6 new moons and four new rings on the planet Uranus ㅤ</p>
  <p id="p1">-pictures of ⅔ of the Neptune moon, Triton, which showed a nitrogen ice volcano on its surface. ㅤ</p>
  <p id="p1">-data on high-energy shock-energized ions 
ㅤ</p>
  <p id="p1">-reaching Interstellar Space
ㅤ</p>

</p>
  <p id="p1">On Aug. 30, 2007, Voyager 2 passed the termination shock.</p>
  <p id="p1">
Shortly after, its attitude control thrusters were no longer in much shape to keep the antenna pointed at Earth. The trajectory correction maneuver thrusters were successfully used in place of those. 
</p>
  <p id="p1">In December 2018, Voyager 2 entered interstellar space.

  <h4 id="p1">Voyager 1: Voyager 2's Twin</h4>
  <p id="p1">Voyager 1, weirdly, was launched after the Voyager 2, on Sept. 5, 1977 at 12:56:01 UT</p>
  <p id="p1">It was the very first spacecraft (a probe, in this case) to cross the heliosphere/heliopause. 
This means that it was the first probe to reach Interstellar Space.
</p>
  <p id="p1">It completed 2 flyby’s: one on Jupiter and another on Saturn.</p>

  <p id="p1">ㅤ</p>
  <p id="p1">ㅤ</p>
  
  <h4 id="p1">Here are a few of its accomplishments:</h4>
  <p id="p1">-discovery of moons Thebe and Metis 




</p>
  <p id="p1">-found five new Saturn moons </p>
  <p id="p1">-discovered a new Saturn ring (the G-ring)  </p>
  <p id="p1">-gathering of data on Saturn’s moon Titan  </p>
  <p id="p1"> -reaching Interstellar Space</p>
  <p id="p1"> </p>
  <p id="p1">Voyager 1 overtook Pioneer 10 at the distance of 69.4 AU (astronomical units) from the Sun, becoming the most distant human-made spacecraft, and object in existence. </p>
  
  <p id="p1">ㅤ</p>
  <p id="p1">ㅤ</p>
  
  <p id="p1">Did you know that the Voyagers were equipped with messages on a disc for the possibility of extraterrestrials (aliens) who may happen to find it? </p>
  <p id="p1">The record has symbols which show Earth’s relative location. The disc has greetings in 55 languages, 35 sounds from life on Earth, and 90 minutes of generally Western music including everything from Mozart and Bach to Chuck Berry and Blind Willie Johnson. It also includes 115 images of life on Earth and recorded greetings from then U.S. President Jimmy Carter (1924– ) and then-UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim (1918-2007).</p>

  <p id="p1">
The Voyagers, at this point in time, are now very far from the Sun - around 18 Billion km away. 
</p>
  <p id="p1">
Eventually though, like all probes, they will run out of electricity. Then, they will infinitely drift across space - on an eternal journey.
